# Optional: Matplotlib

Matplotlib is historically the defacto plotting library for python. There are many other libraries build on top of Matplotlib, such as Seaborn which we will be discussing later.

While it is not required for the rest of the course, it can be good to know a bit about how Matplotlib works.
