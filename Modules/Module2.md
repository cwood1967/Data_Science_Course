# Data Science Module 2: Pandas

Now that we have brushed up on our Python skills, we will dive int Pandas! Pandas is the main package that we will use for our Data Science endeavors and we will learn it over the course of four modules.

# Google Colab

[Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) is a Google research project created to help disseminate machine learning education and research. It's a Jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup to use and runs entirely in the cloud. We will be using Colab for the rest of the course, so it is a good idea to have it set up in preparation for the next module.

While you can use Colab without an account, Colab saves notebooks to Google Drive. So the only way to save your coding progress is by signing in with your google account.

## Colab Setup

- Go to [colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com/)
- In the top right corner click **Sign In** (big blue button)
  - If you don't see the sign in button, you may already be signed into your google account
- Enter your google account information *--OR--* click **Create account** link to make a new account

**Important:**

If you wish to save progress, make sure you copy the notebook to your drive BEFORE you start working on it!

# Lessons

Go through each of the following notebooks. The link will open in your new Colab account. Run each cell to view the output.

- [Pandas Intro](https://colab.research.google.com/github/richard-alexander/Data_Science_Course/blob/master/Pandas/Pandas_0_Intro.ipynb)
- [Pandas Data Structures](https://colab.research.google.com/github/richard-alexander/Data_Science_Course/blob/master/Pandas/Pandas_1_Data_Structure.ipynb)
- [Pandas Statistics](https://colab.research.google.com/github/richard-alexander/Data_Science_Course/blob/master/Pandas/Pandas_2_Statistics.ipynb)

**TIP:**

You can run a notebook cell two ways:
- Click the green play button in the cell
- Press `SHIFT + ENTER` on your keyboard
