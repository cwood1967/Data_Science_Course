# Data Science Module 1: Python

Because we are learning data science in Python, it is a good idea to brush up on python syntax before we dive into new packages. If you are a python expert, you can safely skip this section. But because we will be using a lot of indexing functions, it is highly recommended to go through the section on `Python Lists` and `Numpy` at the very least.

Make sure you complete the *Google Colab* setup below to be ready to start Pandas in the next module!

# DataCamp

DataCamp is a website dedicated to teaching data science. They have great online tutorials, and we will be using several of their modules to begin our learning process.

In order to access them, you will need to create a free account.

- Go to [datacamp.com](https://www.datacamp.com/)
- The **Create Your Free Account** section is at the top of the page
- Enter your email and a new password

# Introduction to Python

The introduction to python course has four chapters. Make sure you have created an account (above) then click each link below and complete the lessons, starting with python basics.

- [Python Basics](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science/chapter-1-python-basics)

- [Python Lists](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science/chapter-2-python-lists)

- [Functions and Packages](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science/chapter-3-functions-and-packages)

- [Numpy](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science/chapter-4-numpy)

# Matplotlib

Matplotlib is historically the defacto plotting library for python. There are many other libraries build on top of Matplotlib, such as Seaborn which we will be discussing later.  While it is not required for the rest of the course, it can be good to know a bit about how Matplotlib works.

# Google Colab

[Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) is a Google research project created to help disseminate machine learning education and research. It's a Jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup to use and runs entirely in the cloud. We will be using Colab for the rest of the course, so it is a good idea to have it set up in preparation for the next module.

While you can use Colab without an account, Colab saves notebooks to Google Drive. So the only way to save your coding progress is by signing in with your google account.

## Colab Setup

- Go to [colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com/)
- In the top right corner click **Sign In** (big blue button)
  - If you don't see the sign in button, you may already be signed into your google account
- Enter your google account information *--OR--* click **Create account** link to make a new account

# Matplotlib in Colab

Chris has made a couple of introductory notebooks for Matplotlib. Now that you have a Colab account, go through these two notebooks and make sure it works as expected:

- [Matplotlib Basics](https://colab.research.google.com/github/richard-alexander/Data_Science_Course/blob/master/Matplotlib/matplotlib_basics.ipynb)
- [Matplotlib Bar Chart](https://colab.research.google.com/github/richard-alexander/Data_Science_Course/blob/master/Matplotlib/matplotlib_barplot.ipynb)


**TIP:**

You can run a notebook cell two ways:
- Click the green play button in the cell
- Press `SHIFT + ENTER` on your keyboard
